This dataset contains the raw EEG data accompanying the paper "The transformation of sensory to perceptual braille letter representations in the visually deprived brain". Please cite the above paper if you use this data.

The dataset includes:

Brainvision files (.eeg, .vhdr, .vmrk) for all participants.

Please note, for some participants the EEG decording had to be stopped and restarted within a session. In this case, the different files are indicated as separate runs. In addition, some participants completed a second session.

The events files contain the onsets, durations, trial types and values for all trials in the corresponding run. Stimuli are Braille letters (B,C,D,L,M,N,V,Z) presented on Braille cells under the left and right index fingers of participants. Triggers S1-8 are letters presented to the left hand, triggers S9-16 are letters presented to the right hand. 

Other triggers:

starttrigger         = S100;
trialonset           = S101;
stimulusonset        = S222;
catchtrial           = S200;
pedalpress_correct   = S253;
pedalpress_incorrect = S254;
endtrigger           = S255;
